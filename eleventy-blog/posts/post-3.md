                    <p>The Most Random Blog Post Of 2020 Ever!</p>

Let’s try something a little different.

I know this is a personal development blog and it’s intended to always be that, but I want to write something a little different today. This is a post about literally anything and everything that comes into my mind this morning.

I fancied practicing my typing skills again and so as I transition into my new lifestyle of being self employed (more on this in a bit) I really need to get used to typing fast! So there’s a very good chance no one is going to read this as it’s not targeted around any keywords.

I’m (When I first typed this sentence, there was a spelling mistake, and for about 20 minutes I didn’t notice! I’m an expert I promise!) an SEO expert meaning I can get posts to rank well on the search engines.
